## Firestore Security Rules

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{uid}/tasks/{taskId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }
  }
}
```

These rules ensure users can only access their own tasks.
